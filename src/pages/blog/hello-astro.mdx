# Hello Astro!

Welcome to my new Astro-powered blog! I recently migrated from WordPress using **wp2astro** and I'm excited to share my experience.

## Why I Switched to Astro

After years of managing WordPress sites, I was looking for something:

- **Faster** - No more slow loading times
- **Simpler** - No database, no PHP, just Markdown
- **Modern** - Built with the latest web technologies

## The Migration Experience

The migration process was surprisingly smooth. With wp2astro, I was able to:

1. Export my WordPress content
2. Create a new Astro repository
3. Launch a Codespace environment
4. Start customizing immediately

### What I Love About Astro

```javascript
// Writing code examples is so easy!
const greeting = "Hello, Astro!";
console.log(greeting);
```

The developer experience is fantastic. Hot reload, TypeScript support, and component islands make building fast.

## Moving Forward

I'm excited to continue building with Astro. Stay tuned for more posts about web development, performance optimization, and my journey away from WordPress!

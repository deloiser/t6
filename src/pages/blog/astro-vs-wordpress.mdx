# Astro vs WordPress: A Performance Comparison

After migrating several sites from WordPress to Astro, I wanted to share some real-world performance comparisons.

## The Test Setup

I migrated a mid-sized blog with:
- 50 blog posts
- 10 pages
- Multiple images
- Contact form

### WordPress Setup
- Shared hosting ($10/month)
- Basic caching plugin
- Optimized images
- Minimal plugins (8 total)

### Astro Setup
- Static hosting on Netlify (free)
- Build time: ~30 seconds
- CDN distribution included

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | WordPress | Astro | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Time to First Byte | 850ms | 120ms | **86% faster** |
| First Contentful Paint | 1.8s | 0.4s | **78% faster** |
| Largest Contentful Paint | 3.2s | 0.8s | **75% faster** |
| Page Size | 2.8MB | 180KB | **94% smaller** |
| Lighthouse Score | 67 | 100 | **49% better** |

## Cost Comparison

### WordPress
- Hosting: $10/month
- Premium plugins: $15/month
- Backup service: $5/month
- **Total: $30/month = $360/year**

### Astro
- Hosting: Free (Netlify)
- Build minutes: Free tier
- CDN: Included
- **Total: $0/year**

## Developer Experience

### WordPress Pros
✅ User-friendly admin panel  
✅ Huge plugin ecosystem  
✅ Non-technical users can edit content  

### WordPress Cons
❌ Security updates required  
❌ Plugin conflicts  
❌ Performance overhead  
❌ Database management  

### Astro Pros
✅ Lightning fast builds  
✅ Component-based architecture  
✅ No security patches needed  
✅ Git-based workflow  
✅ TypeScript support  

### Astro Cons
❌ Steeper learning curve  
❌ Command-line required  
❌ No visual editor (by default)  

## Content Management

### Editing in WordPress
1. Log into admin panel
2. Navigate to posts
3. Edit in block editor
4. Click publish

### Editing in Astro
1. Open Markdown file in editor
2. Make changes
3. Commit to Git
4. Automatic deployment

For developers, Git-based workflows are actually **faster** and provide:
- Version control
- Collaboration tools
- Review processes
- Rollback capabilities

## SEO Capabilities

Both platforms are SEO-capable, but Astro has advantages:

- **Faster page loads** = better rankings
- **Clean HTML** = easier for search engines
- **Automatic sitemaps** = better indexing
- **RSS feeds** = content syndication

## When to Choose WordPress

WordPress is still the right choice if you:

- Need a visual editor for non-technical users
- Require complex user authentication
- Want to quickly add features via plugins
- Don't have developer resources

## When to Choose Astro

Astro is ideal if you:

- Want maximum performance
- Have developer resources
- Prefer Git-based workflows
- Need a blog or content site
- Want to minimize costs

## Migration Tips

If you're considering the switch:

1. **Start small** - Migrate a test site first
2. **Export content** - Use WordPress XML export
3. **Convert to Markdown** - Tools exist for this
4. **Test thoroughly** - Check all pages and links
5. **Set up redirects** - Maintain SEO value

## The Verdict

For content-focused sites where performance matters, **Astro is a clear winner**. The speed improvements, cost savings, and developer experience make it worth the migration effort.

However, WordPress remains valuable for sites that need:
- Complex admin workflows
- Non-technical content editors
- E-commerce capabilities
- Extensive plugin functionality

## Conclusion

Both tools have their place. For my use case (developer-maintained blog), Astro was the perfect choice. The performance gains alone justify the migration.

What's your experience? Are you considering the switch?
